              <h3>Why the Pouty face?</h3>
              <p>This will be the top story for the week. The most intriguing news or feature that has garnered some following on social media and word of mouth.
                <p>I can't quite remember what was the story here, but I sure do not like the fact that they made me face the wall. This is CHILD ABUSE!</p>
                <p>I will not let this pass! In a year or two, I will SUE!</p>

                <p>This is my mom, she likes to run because she thinks it's hip.
                  <p>I am not sure though, if she even broke a sweat during that quick video.</p>
                  <p>That is me in the inset picture, cheering her on.</p>

                <h3>My first Marathon</h3>
                <p>They say it will be difficult to get yourself fit, when you get older. More so if you don't have lots of motivation or buddies to work-out with.
                  <p>So, I might as well start early, so that it becomes a lifestyle. Rather than sitting on my bum all day. (But...that's hard work too, right?)</p>
                  <p>This is me: finishing my first marathon (42km)</p>
                  <p>Isn't that how champions pass the finish line?</p>
                  <p>EXHAUSTED! Now, where was that tub of ice cream?</p>
